=head1 NAME

Net::DigitalNZ - Perl interface to digitalnz.org 's open data api.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The metadata available through DigitalNZ comes from content providers across the New Zealand cultural and heritage, broadcasting, education, and government sectors; as well as local community sources and individuals.

You will need to obtain your own API key from http://digitalnz.org

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     use Net::DigitalNZ;
     my $query = 'Waitangi';
     my $api_key = 'get your own api key';
     my $searcher = Net::DigitalNZ->new(api_key => $api_key);
     my $results = $searcher->search($query);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 search

The search records API call is passed a search query and returns a corresponding result set

     # simple query
     my $results = $searcher->search($query);

     # more complicated query
     my $results = $searcher->search($query, {key => value});

=head3 Parameters

=over 4

=item num_results

the number of results the user wishes returned

=item start

the offset from which the result list should start

=item sort

the field upon which results are sorted. If sort_field isn't specified the results are sorted by relevance. The sort_field must be one of: category, content_provider, date, syndication_date, title

=item direction

the direction in which the results are sorted. Can only be used in conjunction with the sort field and must be either asc or desc. If not specified, sort_direction defaults to asc

=item facets

a list of facet fields to include in the output. See the note on facets below for more information.

=item facet_num_results

the number of facet results to include. Only used if the facets parameter is specified, and defaults to 10.

=item facet_start

the offset from which the facet value list should start. Only used if the facets parameter is specified, and defaults to 0.

=back

=head3 Example

     use Net::DigitalNZ;

     my $query = 'Waitangi';
     my $api_key = 'get your own api key from http://digitalnz.org';

     my $searcher = Net::DigitalNZ->new(api_key => $api_key);
     my $results = $searcher->search($query, {
                          start=>10,
                          num_results => 2}
                   );

     print $results->{result_count} . " items found\n";

     foreach my $r (@{ $results->{results} } ) {
          print $r->{id} . ': '. $r->{title} ."\n";
     }

=item results

the search results data. The results element will contain 0 or more result elements, each containing the following elements:

=over 4

=item category

=item content_provider

=head2 getmetadata

The get metadata for a specific record call returns the available metadata for a requested item.
